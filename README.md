# XVECS
Yet another implementation of Table-Style Archetypal ECS. The following library is part of my personal Toy Engine and is heavily WIP.

This ECS aims to achieve the following or explore:
- Multi World Usage
- Efficient DOD Format
- Free Tagging Components (To resolve the bane of copying entities between archetypes)

Unlike Unity Archetypal ECS, XVECS will not support Shared Components.

Defined:
- Entity
- Component
- Query
- Pool

WIP:
- Universe 
- World
- Archetype
- System
